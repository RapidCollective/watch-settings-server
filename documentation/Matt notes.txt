Version 0.1 goal: Build a somewhat broken, but functional flow to the whole thing.

Version 0.2 goal: Integrate Matt's union structs, and make the whole thing more soft coded.
- Use the ASCII List method instead of hard coding methods.
- Use the config structure.
- Eliminates the need for appKeys to be manually entered.

developer sees the method: get_config("user_name");


Version 0.3 goal: Locally host HTML pages
- Eliminates the need for versioned hosted HTML pages. Every binary should just work.

Version 0.4 goal: Proxy app message
- Eliminates the need to drop into the main C file a appmessage listener.
